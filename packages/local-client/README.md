# Jbook App

This project is a portfolio project where users can write and execute jsx code.

JSX code runs in browsers in a iframe window and esbuild is used to compile the codes. There are some limitations like localStorage but it is fast and reliable with cashing.

I'm adding releases to learn about version control and having each version of development files.
